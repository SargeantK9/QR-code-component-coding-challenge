# QR code component coding challenge
 Generate a QR code as close to design as possible for challenge.

 First, I generated the HTML file with provided favicon as icon. I always set body margins and font-size to 0 to remove most of the default formatting I find most troublesome.
 Then I added the QR code image and wrote an h2 and p element to house the text. I created a CSS file and linked it in the HTML file header. Then I created a div containing the image and text. I formatted this with background-color: white and border-radius (trial and error, I settled on 5%). I formatted the image next and set the width and matched the border-radius to the container. Then I formatted the text and fiddled with the rest of the formatting to create a reasonable mimic to the design example for desktop.
